# PlantModules.jl

A Julia package for defining Functional-Structural Plant Modeling (FSPMs) based on [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) created to work well together with Julia's plant modeling framework [VirtualPlantLab.jl](https://github.com/VirtualPlantLab/VirtualPlantLab.jl).
This package is still under active development, but core functionality is already available. 

## 1. Installation

The package is currently not yet in the Julia registry. Therefore, installation of the package can be done through:
```julia
] add https://github.com/bspanoghe/PlantModules.jl.git
```

## 2. Usage

The package currently has no documentation page yet. However, Pluto notebooks with an explanation of how to use the package are available in the tutorial folder.
