## Introduction 👋

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of using the PlantModules package. Here's a brief overview:
- Toy problem: when to water your pepper seedlings
- Creating a modular plant model
  - Defining structural and functional plant modules
  - Specifying model parameters
  - Describing how the modules interact
- Running the model
- Answering the toy question

### Context

For the first tutorial, we will model the response of a hypothetical tomato plant to different transpiration rates.

### Loading the necessary packages

Before we can get started, we need to do some basic setup: activating our project and loading in the required packages.

## Modeling with PlantModules
"""

# ╔═╡ 6ef5c63a-b753-43ae-baee-f6c24313a385
md"""
As the name suggests, one of the most important goals of PlantModules is to enable the user to easily model plant growth in a _modular_ manner. In order to achieve this, we will define our plant in function of a few sets of similarly behaving parts or "modules" for short. Parts of the same module can be similar on the structural - and on the functional level.

On the structural level, some examples are:
- An oak tree can be considered a repeating module in a forest.
- A branch can be considered a repeating module in a tree.
- A collenchyma cell can be considered a repeating module in a branch.

On the functional level, on the other hand:
- Most structural modules of a tree (branches, leaves, root segments, etc.) contain water which will flow between them as dictated by hydraulic laws, which plays an important role in plant growth. All these structural modules share this same functional module. 
- One or more of the plant's structural modules will assimilate carbon through photosynthesis, while the others do not. On the cellular level, only cells containing chloroplasts should share this functional module.

As such, the workflow to create a model in PlantModules boils down to defining these modules and how they interact. Let's jump right in!

### The plant

The first step in modeling our plant's growth is defining its structure.
For the first tutorial, we'll consider a very simple example: a tine tomato plant with a small stem and two leaves.
"""

# ╔═╡ 659e911c-8af2-4a66-855a-e333c41120c1
md"""
PlantModules uses **graphs** to define the relationships between modules. As such, structural modules need to be implemented as graph nodes of some sort. We'll be using the graph implementation from [the PlantGraphs](https://virtualplantlab.com/stable/manual/Graphs/) package for this tutorial, though [any graph implementation can be used](nothinghere).
"""

# ╔═╡ 0cc02e82-4fe8-4f27-a2d2-eb4bfba6b291
md"""
For our example, we will define two structural modules: a `Stem` module and a `Leaf` module. We will give both modules an attribute `D`, which corresponds to the name of the variable expressing the dimensions of the structural module. This is a vector containing one to three numbers, depending on whether the plant part is modelled as a sphere, a cylinder or a cuboid. The Leaves will be represented as flat cuboids, while the stem will be represented as a cylinder.

### The environment

Plants need an environment to grow in. For most plants, the most basic environmental compartments that need defining are the soil, from which the plant gets water and nutrients, and the air, with which the plant exchanges gasses. We can make these compartments as complex as we want, such as different soil compartments for different layers, but we will stick to one graph node for each for now.

# ╔═╡ c36668fa-3046-4967-a616-841a048ea7f9
md"""
We also need to define the connections between these environmental modules and the plant. Sadly, connecting both leaf nodes to the air would introduce a cycle into our graph, which is something many plant-focused graph implementations do not support.

To overcome this, PlantModules allows the user to input multiple graphs and then specify how to connect them:
"""

# ╔═╡ 20049311-d6e6-41d3-a0d8-8bad88c174f9

The above syntax means: "connect the first node from `graphs[1]` to all Soil nodes from `graphs[2]`", and all `Leaf` nodes from `graphs[1]` to all `Air` nodes from `graphs[3]`. Note that the order matters! For example, `[1, 2] => (:Root, :Soil)` is not the same as `[2, 1] => (:Root, :Soil)`.
"""

# ╔═╡ 668e02ee-ac78-4b3d-983d-402ec04584ef

The full structural connection information can then be acquired by bundling the graphs and connections into the `PlantStructure` wrapper.

Now that we have an idea of the plant's structural modules, we need to assign them some kind of functionality. `PlantModules` expresses these as sets of differential equations, implemented in [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/). Assigning functionality then comes down to writing out the desired functional processes as `ModelingToolkit` models (or choosing them out from the prebuilt ones), mapping them to the structural modules, and finally specifying the initial- and parameter values for the different components of the system.

- Carbon dynamics
    - `constant_carbon_module`: describes a compartment with a constant amount of carbon.
    - `simple_photosynthesis_module`: describes a compartment with carbon being produced during day and consumed proportionally to its concentration.
- Total water potential
    - `Ψ_soil_module`: describes an empirical relationship between the total water potential and relative water content of soil.
    - `Ψ_air_module`: describes the relationship between the total water potential and water potential of air.
- Hydraulic conductivity
    - `K_module`: describes hydraulic conductivity as proportional to the cross area of the compartment. 
    - `constant_K_module`: describes a constant hydraulic conductivity.
- Connection modules
    - `hydraulic_connection`: describes a water flow between two compartments based on the hydraulic conductivities of those compartments.
    - `evaporation_connection`: describes a water flow between two compartments based on the hydraulic conductivities of those compartments that decreases during night.
    - `constant_hydraulic_connection`: describes a water flow between two compartments and specifies its own hydraulic conductivity.

Next to the equations themselves, an important part in describing the plant's functional processes is defining the equations' parameter - and initial values. Since we'll restrict ourselves to hydraulic equations for this tutorial, these parameters and variables are the ones described in the section [Theoretical overview](nothinghere).

In PlantModules, parameter - and initial values are defined in a hierarchical manner, here listed in ascending priority:

> **Model-wide default values < module-specific default values < node-specific values**

For our current example, this means that there is no point in specifying the initial values for the compartment dimensions *D* for our Leaf compartments in the module-specific default values or the model-wide default values, since we already defined these values in all of the Leaf nodes of the graph, which have the highest priority.
